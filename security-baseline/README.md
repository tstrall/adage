# Security Baseline

This guide walks through the essential security services that should be enabled in every AWS account ‚Äî particularly in production or shared environments.

These services are foundational for visibility, compliance, and incident response across your organization.

---

## Why This Matters

Enabling these baseline services allows you to:

- Track who did what, when, and where
- Detect suspicious behavior or unauthorized changes
- Comply with security best practices and audits
- Build a foundation for alerts, forensic investigation, and cost control

---

## Steps

### 1. Enable CloudTrail

CloudTrail records API activity and resource changes in your AWS account.

- Go to **CloudTrail** in the AWS Console
- Choose **"Create trail"**
- Enable a **multi-region trail**
- Store logs in an S3 bucket (you can reuse across accounts)
- (Optional) Enable CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual API usage patterns

---

### 2. Enable AWS Config

AWS Config records the configuration history and compliance state of your AWS resources.

- Go to **AWS Config**
- Set up a **recording group** (record all resources, all regions)
- Choose an S3 bucket to store snapshots
- (Optional) Set up rules to detect noncompliant resources

This helps with drift detection, audit trails, and enforcing tagging or encryption requirements.

‚û°Ô∏è See examples below.

---

### 3. Enable GuardDuty

Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior.

- Go to **GuardDuty**
- Click **"Enable GuardDuty"**
- Leave all default settings enabled

GuardDuty continuously analyzes CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.

---

### 4. (Optional) Enable Security Hub

Security Hub provides a centralized view of your security posture by aggregating findings from:

- GuardDuty
- AWS Config
- IAM Access Analyzer
- Other third-party tools

You can enable it from the **Security Hub** console and choose which services to integrate.

---

## Example AWS Config Rules

Once AWS Config is enabled, you can define rules to enforce specific security and tagging requirements.

### Required Tags Rule

This built-in rule checks whether required tags (e.g., `Project`, `Environment`) are present:

```json
{
  "ConfigRuleName": "required-tags",
  "SourceIdentifier": "REQUIRED_TAGS",
  "InputParameters": {
    "tag1Key": "Project",
    "tag2Key": "Environment",
    "tag3Key": "Owner"
  }
}
```

This rule helps enforce your [Tagging Policy](../tagging-policy/README.md).

---

### S3 Bucket Encryption Rule

Ensure all S3 buckets have default encryption enabled:

- Use managed rule ID: `S3_BUCKET_SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED`

This can help enforce compliance with security standards like SOC2, HIPAA, or internal policies.

---

### IAM Password Policy Rule

Require strong password policies in IAM:

- Rule ID: `IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY`
- Detects weak or missing account password settings

---

## Recommended Order of Operations

If you're working within an AWS Organization:

- Enable these services in the **management account** first
- Use **AWS Config Aggregators** or **GuardDuty Organizations** to collect findings across accounts
- Ensure **CloudTrail logs** are stored in a centralized logging bucket (with versioning and access logging enabled)

---

## Next Steps

Once security monitoring is enabled:

- [Review the Tagging Policy](../tagging-policy/README.md) ‚Äî Enforce required tags using AWS Config rules
- [Ensure Identity Center is configured](../identity-center/README.md) ‚Äî Avoid relying on IAM users for ongoing access
- [Begin deploying infrastructure](../quickstarts/serverless-site.md) ‚Äî Start applying these practices in real-world projects
