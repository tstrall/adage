# üõ°Ô∏è Security Baseline: CloudTrail, GuardDuty & AWS Config

This guide outlines a minimal but strong security baseline for AWS environments. It assumes IAM Identity Center is enabled, and applies equally across single-account and multi-account setups.

---

## üéØ Goal

- Record all AWS API activity using **CloudTrail**
- Enable threat detection via **Amazon GuardDuty**
- Track resource configuration changes with **AWS Config**
- Store logs in a secure, dedicated S3 bucket (optional but recommended)

---

## üìú Step 1: Enable CloudTrail (All API Activity)

1. Go to **CloudTrail** in the AWS Console
2. Click **Create trail**
3. Trail type: **Organization trail** (if using AWS Organizations), otherwise create a standard trail
4. Name your trail: `org-cloudtrail` or `default-cloudtrail`
5. Apply trail to: **All Regions** (recommended)
6. Create a new S3 bucket for logs, or use an existing secure logging bucket
7. Enable log file validation (recommended)
8. Finish creation

‚úÖ CloudTrail now records all API events and stores them in the configured S3 bucket.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Step 2: Enable Amazon GuardDuty (Threat Detection)

1. Go to **GuardDuty** in the AWS Console
2. Click **Enable GuardDuty**
3. It will begin monitoring for threats such as:
   - Unusual API calls
   - Access from known malicious IPs
   - Unauthorized data access or exfiltration
4. (Optional) If using AWS Organizations, configure a delegated administrator account

‚úÖ GuardDuty starts analyzing logs and events immediately after activation.

---

## üîç Step 3: Enable AWS Config (Resource Tracking)

1. Go to **AWS Config** in the Console
2. Click **Set up AWS Config**
3. Record all resources in **All Regions** (recommended)
4. Create or reuse an S3 bucket to store configuration snapshots
5. Create an IAM role if prompted
6. (Optional) Add rules like:
   - Required tags
   - No unencrypted volumes
   - IAM policy change tracking

‚úÖ AWS Config will now track changes to your resources and evaluate compliance rules.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Optional: Centralized Logging Bucket

In multi-account setups:
- Create a dedicated `log-archive` S3 bucket in the management account
- Set bucket policies to allow CloudTrail logs from all accounts
- Enable **Object Lock** or **S3 versioning** for immutability (optional but recommended)

You can also aggregate GuardDuty and Config findings centrally.

---

## üîí Best Practices

- Restrict access to log and config buckets using IAM and bucket policies
- Enable MFA and Identity Center enforcement for all users
- Monitor IAM usage and periodically review unused roles or keys
- Use AWS Organizations and SCPs to prevent dangerous actions (e.g., disabling CloudTrail)

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

You now have:
- Full activity logging via CloudTrail
- Threat detection via GuardDuty
- Resource tracking and compliance checks via AWS Config
- (Optionally) centralized logs for visibility and long-term storage

These services form the backbone of your AWS security posture.
