# Security Baseline

This guide walks through the essential security services that should be enabled in every AWS account ‚Äî particularly in production or shared environments.

These services are foundational for visibility, compliance, and incident response across your organization.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cost Awareness

All of the services recommended on this page **potentially incur cost**, though some may be reasonable under the Free Tier or offer free trials.

- CloudTrail: Free for management events, but S3 storage can cost
- AWS Config: Charged per configuration item recorded
- GuardDuty: Free for 30 days, then per-GB/event
- Security Hub: Free for 30 days, then per rule/finding

We recommend enabling these even in development accounts, but monitoring usage and billing early on.

---

## Why This Matters

Enabling these baseline services allows you to:

- Track who did what, when, and where
- Detect suspicious behavior or unauthorized changes
- Comply with security best practices and audits
- Build a foundation for alerts, forensic investigation, and cost control

---

## Steps

### 1. Enable CloudTrail

CloudTrail records API activity and resource changes in your AWS account.

- ‚úÖ **Cost Note**: One multi-region trail for management events is free for 90 days.  
  Logs stored in S3 may incur storage charges depending on size and retention.

**To enable:**

- Go to **CloudTrail** in the AWS Console
- Choose **"Create trail"**
- Enable a **multi-region trail**
- Store logs in an S3 bucket (you can reuse across accounts)
- (Optional) Enable CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual API usage patterns

---

### 2. Enable AWS Config

AWS Config records the configuration history and compliance state of your AWS resources.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cost Note**: Charged per configuration item recorded, which can grow quickly in large environments.  
  Free Tier covers 7 configuration items per region.

**To enable:**

- Go to **AWS Config**
- Set up a **recording group** (record all resources, all regions)
- Choose an S3 bucket to store snapshots
- (Optional) Set up rules to detect noncompliant resources

‚û°Ô∏è See below for example rules.

---

### 3. Enable GuardDuty

Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cost Note**: Free for 30 days, then charged based on analyzed data volume (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, DNS logs).

**To enable:**

- Go to **GuardDuty**
- Click **"Enable GuardDuty"**
- Leave all default settings enabled

---

### 4. (Optional) Enable Security Hub

Security Hub provides a centralized view of your security posture by aggregating findings from GuardDuty, AWS Config, and other services.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cost Note**: Free for 30 days, then charges based on active security standards and findings.

**To enable:**

- Go to **Security Hub**
- Click **"Enable Security Hub"**
- Choose which standards and integrations to enable (e.g., CIS, AWS Foundational)

---

## Example AWS Config Rules

Once AWS Config is enabled, you can define rules to enforce specific security and tagging requirements.

### Required Tags Rule

This built-in rule checks whether required tags (e.g., `Project`, `Environment`) are present:

```json
{
  "ConfigRuleName": "required-tags",
  "SourceIdentifier": "REQUIRED_TAGS",
  "InputParameters": {
    "tag1Key": "Project",
    "tag2Key": "Environment",
    "tag3Key": "Owner"
  }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è Supports your [Tagging Policy](../tagging-policy/README.md)

---

### S3 Bucket Encryption Rule

Ensure all S3 buckets have default encryption enabled:

- Rule ID: `S3_BUCKET_SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED`

---

### IAM Password Policy Rule

Require strong password policies in IAM:

- Rule ID: `IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY`

---

## Recommended Order of Operations

If you're working within an AWS Organization:

- Ensure **CloudTrail logs** are stored in a centralized logging bucket (with versioning and access logging enabled)
- Enable these services in the **management account** first
- Use **AWS Config Aggregators** or **GuardDuty Organizations** to collect findings across accounts

---

## Next Steps

Once security monitoring is enabled:

- [Review the Tagging Policy](../tagging-policy/README.md) ‚Äî Enforce required tags using AWS Config rules
- [Track costs and activate cost allocation tags](../cost-management/README.md) ‚Äî Ensure you can attribute spend across environments
