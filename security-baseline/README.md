# Security Baseline

This guide outlines the minimum recommended AWS security services to enable across your organization. These services provide monitoring, auditing, and threat detection ‚Äî even before deploying any application infrastructure.

---

## Overview

The goal of a security baseline is to:

- Monitor all accounts for suspicious activity
- Ensure changes are auditable
- Establish consistent behavior across environments
- Catch misconfigurations early

---

## Services to Enable

### 1. AWS CloudTrail (Organization-wide)

CloudTrail records all account activity (API calls, console actions, etc.).

- Enable CloudTrail in the management account
- Choose ‚ÄúApply to all accounts in my organization‚Äù
- Store logs in a dedicated S3 bucket with versioning
- Use SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS encryption
- Optionally log to CloudWatch Logs or send alerts via EventBridge

### 2. AWS Config

AWS Config tracks resource configuration changes over time.

- Enable in each account, or at the organization level
- Use an aggregator to centralize visibility
- Store snapshots in S3 for auditing

This helps detect drift, noncompliance, or manual changes.

### 3. Amazon GuardDuty

GuardDuty continuously monitors for unusual or malicious activity.

- Enable GuardDuty in each account
- Choose a delegated administrator (usually the security or management account)
- Centralize findings in one account
- Optionally enable auto-remediation via EventBridge rules

---

## Optional Enhancements

- Enable AWS Security Hub to aggregate findings from Config, GuardDuty, and other tools
- Use AWS Detective to visualize relationships and investigate issues
- Set up SCPs (Service Control Policies) to restrict risky actions in production accounts

---

## After This

Once these services are enabled:

- All account activity is logged and auditable
- Security events are centralized
- You can define remediation workflows

Next:

- [Apply consistent tagging](../tagging-policy/README.md)
- [Start deploying infrastructure](../quickstarts/serverless-site.md)
