# Adage: A Configuration-Driven AWS Deployment Framework

## Overview

This repository explains how to implement a **Configuration-Driven AWS Deployment Model**, allowing you to:

- **Build AWS infrastructure once, then deploy dynamically via configuration updates**
- **Separate infrastructure (IaC), configuration (JSON), and application code (Lambdas)**
- **Resolve dependencies dynamically using AWS Parameter Store**
- **Ensure security and auditability by managing deployments through Git**

---

## How the Repositories Work Together

This model is composed of **three Git repositories** plus this documentation repo:

1. **[`aws-iac`](https://github.com/tstrall/aws-iac)** ‚Äì Terraform modules for reusable AWS infrastructure
2. **[`aws-config`](https://github.com/tstrall/aws-config)** ‚Äì Git-controlled JSON config, synced to Parameter Store
3. **[`aws-lambda`](https://github.com/tstrall/aws-lambda)** ‚Äì Lambda functions that resolve their dependencies dynamically

This repository (**Adage**) provides a guided tour and design rationale for using them together.

## Quickstart: Build Your Own Serverless Static Website

Once your AWS account is bootstrapped and Identity Center is set up, follow this quickstart to deploy infrastructure for a serverless static site with CloudFront and S3:

## Deployment Flow

### 1. Push Configuration to AWS Parameter Store

Configuration is defined in `aws-config` and synced to Parameter Store using a CI/CD pipeline or script.

```
cd aws-config/
./scripts/deploy.sh <component> <nickname>
```

Each component finds its config under a path like:

```
/iac/<component>/<nickname>/config
```

The contents of AWS Parameter Store defines what can be deployed in a given account.

### 2. Deploy Using Terraform

In `aws-iac`, each component reads from AWS Parameter Store for configuration and writes its runtime outputs back to Parameter Store for other components to read:

```sh
cd aws-iac/
./scripts/deploy.sh <component> <nickname>
```

Each component publishes its runtime info under a path like:

```
/iac/<component>/<nickname>/runtime
```

## Core Design Principles

This project is guided by a fabric of ideas that enable scalable, secure, and flexible AWS infrastructure.

Each principle supports the others, forming a composable system where infrastructure, configuration, and services can evolve independently ‚Äî yet always remain connected.

These principles include:

- **Build Once, Deploy Anywhere** ‚Äì Reusable Terraform components across all environments.
- **Configuration Is the Source of Truth** ‚Äì Git-controlled configs drive every deployment.
- **Immutable Infrastructure** ‚Äì Replace rather than patch, enabling reliable rollouts.
- **Dynamic Dependency Resolution** ‚Äì Services discover dependencies at runtime via nicknames.
- **Separation of Concerns** ‚Äì Infra, config, and app code live in independent repos.
- **External System Referencing** ‚Äì Reference systems you didn‚Äôt create as first-class citizens.
- **Git as the Gatekeeper** ‚Äì Only what‚Äôs defined in Git gets deployed.
- **Optional Smart Caching** ‚Äì Runtime refresh logic when failures occur.
- **LocalStack-Friendly by Default** ‚Äì Develop and test locally with minimal cost.

## Security & Compliance

- All changes must go through Git ‚Äî providing version control and auditability
- IAM permissions can restrict who can modify configuration vs. who can deploy
- Parameter Store and Secrets Manager separate dynamic values from source code

---

## Next Steps

Want to implement this in your AWS environment?

1. **Fork and customize the three core repositories**
2. **Set up a CI/CD pipeline to sync config to Parameter Store**
3. **Define your IAM strategy and tag policies**
4. **Deploy your first component using the quickstart**
