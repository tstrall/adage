# AWS Bootstrap Checklist (For First-Time Setup)

> üéØ Goal: Set up a **secure, taggable, and automation-ready AWS account**  
> üß† This is the minimum manual setup required before you start automating with Terraform.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Create and Secure the Root Account

- [ ] Go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) and **sign up for a new account**
- [ ] Set a strong password
- [ ] Set a **support email you control**
- [ ] **Enable MFA** on the root account
- [ ] Set up **billing alerts** and **budgets** (see [Cost Management](../cost-management/README.md))
- [ ] (Optional) Enable **Free Tier usage alerts**

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Enable IAM Identity Center

- [ ] Go to the **IAM Identity Center** service (default region: `us-east-1`)
- [ ] Click **Enable**
- [ ] Accept the default identity source (built-in directory)
- [ ] Create a user:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Email: your email
- [ ] Wait for the email and set a password

üìå This lays the foundation for all access going forward.  
‚û°Ô∏è [Follow full setup ¬ª](../identity-center/README.md)

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Create a Permission Set

- [ ] Assign the new admin user to your current account
- [ ] Create a permission set:
  - Name: `AdministratorAccess`
  - Policy: AWS-managed `AdministratorAccess`
  - Duration: 8 hours
  - Tags: `Environment=mgmt`, `AccessLevel=admin`

‚úÖ After this, you can now log in as your named admin using the AWS SSO portal.

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Log In as Your Admin

- [ ] Visit your Identity Center portal URL (from the welcome email or Identity Center console)
